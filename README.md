# Reddit-Comment-Removal
This is a machine learning project which trains an algorithm to remove comments from the r/science subreddit based on previous moderator decisions.
A variety of ML algorithms are implemented here. Only some of the optimization of these algorithms is shown in this notebook.
The best solution found was a random forest algorithm which had an accuracy of ~92%.

Future work: This algorithm could probably be improved through the use of profanity filters. Neural networks should also be implemented.
